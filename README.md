Greetings of the day,

Here is my version of weatherWebApp that gives the weather forecast of the user entered city.

This App contains different features and functionalities

1. I have create a homepage that provides a attractive am=nd dynamic user interface. This homepage includes a card to display the weather forecasr along with appropriate weather images. The images of background as per the information received from the API. This also includes a search 
input field where users can enter a location and a button to trigger the weather request.

2. By searching the city the user can get the current weather conditions for the specified location. This includes details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

3. I have added a toggle button that allows users to switch between temperature units (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit) and accordingly to it the weather info gets updated.

4. This application aslo offers an option to use the user's geolocation to automatically. In simple words, when the page loads, it automatically takes the user's location and gives weather information accordingly.

5. I have applied multiple  CSS styles to make the app visually appealing and ensure a good user experience. 

6. This app is completely responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices. 

I have added comments in the code for more readability. Please refer them for further code explanation
